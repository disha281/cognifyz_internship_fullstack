        Princess Charm School is a prestigious academy where young women are
        trained to become confident, graceful, and responsible leaders. The
        school teaches royal etiquette, public speaking, and leadership
        alongside values like kindness, and integrity. Students attend classes
        in posture, manners, and social responsibility while also participating
        in charity work and cultural events. The ultimate goal of Princess Charm
        School is to shape young women into true princessesâ€”defined not by title
        or wealth, but by their character and the way they serve others.
